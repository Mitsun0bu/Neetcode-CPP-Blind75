# Neetcode-CPP-Blind75

This repository contains C++ solutions for the Blind75 coding challenges from https://neetcode.io

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into modules and exercises. Each module contains a set of exercises related to a specific topic:

```Neetcode-CPP-Blind75
├── moduleXX_name
│   ├── exXX_name
│   │    ├── files
│   │    ...
│   ...
```

## Contents

In each exercise directory, you will find the following files:

1. `description.cpp` : A text file containing the problem statement and requirements for the exercise.

2. `Solution.cpp` and `Solution.hpp`: Contain the implementation and declaration of the exercise's solution class.

3. `main.cpp`: A testing file for the provided solution.

4. `test.sh`: A bash script that compiles and executes the program for testing.

## Usage

To test a solution, navigate to the exercise directory and run the `test.sh` script:

```bash
cd module00/ex00_name
./test.sh
```

This will compile the solution and test files and execute the tests, providing the results.
